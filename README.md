## Introduction

As a data analyst, I conducted a detailed financial performance analysis using a dataset consisting of sales and profit data segmented by market and country/region. The project involved importing the dataset as CSV files into Power Query in Excel, where I carried out data cleaning, transformation, and exploration. Following the six stages of the data analytics process â€” Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act â€” I leveraged Excel tools to uncover key insights related to revenue trends, profitability by region, and efficiency across segments, enabling data-driven recommendations for business growth and sustainability.

 ## Ask

 **Problem Statement**

In this stage, the focus was on clearly understanding the business problem and defining the key questions to guide the analysis. The primary objective was:

"How is the company performing financially across different market segments and regions, and where can improvements be made to boost profitability and efficiency?"

* Key guiding questions included:

* Which market segments and regions generate the highest sales and profits?

* Are there regions or segments underperforming financially?

* What trends can be observed in revenue and profit over time?

* How can insights from the data support better decision-making?

This stage helped align the analysis with business goals and ensured that the insights would be relevant and actionable.

## Prepare

**Data Collection and Understanding**

In this stage, I gathered and reviewed the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and relevance to the business objective. The dataset was imported from a CSV file into Power Query in Microsoft Excel, where initial exploration was carried out.

The dataset contains 22 columns and 638 rows, representing sales and profit data across different countries, market segments, and time periods.

#### Dataset Description
* Segment â€“ The business or customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

* Country â€“ The geographic location where the sale occurred.

* Product â€“ The specific item or product sold.

* Discount Band â€“ The category of discount applied (e.g., None, Low, High).

* Units Sold â€“ Total quantity of the product sold.

* Manufacturing Price â€“ Cost to produce a single unit of the product.

* Sale Price â€“ Selling price per unit before discounts.

* Gross Sales â€“ Total revenue before applying discounts (Sale Price Ã— Units Sold).

* Discounts â€“ Total value of discounts given.

* Sales â€“ Net sales amount after applying discounts.

* COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) â€“ Total cost to produce the units sold.

* Profit â€“ Net gain from the sale (Sales - COGS).

* Date â€“ The specific date of transaction or record.

* Month Number â€“ Numerical representation of the month (e.g., 1 for January).

* Month Name â€“ Text format of the month (e.g., January, February).

* Year â€“ The year the sale took place.

* Month Sort â€“ A custom column used to help sort the months chronologically.

* Profit Margin â€“ Percentage of profit from the sales (Profit Ã· Sales).

* Average Revenue Per Unit â€“ Average revenue earned for each unit sold.

* Discount Rate â€“ Percentage of discount applied.

This stage helped confirm the completeness and relevance of the data before proceeding to transformation and analysis.

## Process

**Data Tranformation**

In this stage, I focused on collecting and preparing the data for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency. The dataset, which contained sales and profit data across various market segments and regions, was imported as CSV files into Power Query in Excel for cleaning and transformation.

Key steps taken during this phase included:

* Reviewed and corrected column names to fix any errors or inconsistencies at the point of import.

* Removed unwanted characters such as the '$' sign and '-' from relevant columns to standardize the values.

* Changed data types from text (object) to integers or decimals to enable accurate numerical analysis.

* Removed commas (",") from numerical values to ensure they were correctly recognized as numbers by Excel.

These preparation steps helped create a clean, well-structured dataset ready for in-depth exploration and analysis.


##  Analyze

**Exploring the Data and Generating Insights**

In this stage, I explored the cleaned dataset by applying Excel-based visualizations and dashboards to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships relevant to the financial performance of the company. The analysis focused on the Government segment in the year 2013, and key insights were derived from the dashboard metrics and charts.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Insights from the Analysis: Overall Financial Performance (2013 â€“ Government Segment):**

* Total Profit: $8.5M (+195% vs last year)

* Sales Revenue: $39.4M (+201% vs LY)

* Profit Margin: 29.2% (slightly down -1% vs LY)

* Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $30.9M (+203% vs LY)

* Units Sold: 347.2K (+181% vs LY)

* Average Revenue per Unit: $116.3 (-1% vs LY)

* Total Discount Given: $3.0M (+224% vs LY)

ðŸ“Š **Visual Breakdown & Trends:**
Yearly Trends:

Both profit and sales peaked significantly in October and December, suggesting seasonal spikes in government purchases.

Top Countries by Sales & Profit:

Germany led in performance with $5.7M sales and $1.1M profit.

Other top markets included the USA, France, Canada, and Mexico.

**Product Performance:**

Paseo and Amarilla had the highest COGS and sales figures, with Paseo reaching almost $16M in COGS.

Velo and Paseo received the highest unit discounts, totaling $536.6K and $527.2K respectively.

Profit Margin by Product:

VTT (40.3%), Paseo (37.4%), and Velo (35.2%) had the highest profit margins.

Amarilla had the lowest margin at 18.9%, indicating a possible pricing or cost challenge.

**Conclusion On the Insight**
The Government segment in 2013 showed strong financial performance with a significant increase in sales and profit compared to the previous year. However, attention should be paid to declining average revenue per unit and products with low margins like Amarilla. These findings can help prioritize cost management and marketing focus.
